abstract = {Background: Rising rates of caesarean section (CS) are a concern in many countries, yet Sweden has managed to maintain low CS rates. Exploring the multifactorial and complex reasons behind the rising trend in CS has become an important goal for health professionals. The aim of the study was to explore Swedish obstetricians' and midwives' perceptions of the factors influencing decision-making for CS in nulliparous women in Sweden. Methods: A qualitative design was chosen to gain in-depth understanding of the factors influencing the decision-making process for CS. Purposive sampling was used to select the participants. Four audio-recorded focus group interviews (FGIs), using an interview guide with open ended questions, were conducted with eleven midwives and five obstetricians from two selected Swedish maternity hospitals after obtaining written consent from each participant. Data were managed using NVivo{\textcopyright} and thematically analysed. Ethical approval was granted by Trinity College Dublin. Results: The thematic analysis resulted in three main themes; 'Belief in normal birth - a cultural perspective'; 'Clarity and consistency - a system perspective' and 'Obstetrician makes the final decision, but.', and each theme contained a number of subthemes. However, 'Belief in normal birth' emerged as the core central theme, overarching the other two themes. Conclusion: Findings suggest that believing that normal birth offers women and babies the best possible outcome contributes to having and maintaining a low CS rate. Both midwives and obstetricians agreed that having a shared belief (in normal birth), a common goal (of achieving normal birth) and providing mainly midwife-led care within a 'team approach' helped them achieve their goal and keep their CS rate low.},

abstract = {Background: Approximately 90{\%} of mothers with a primary C-section have a subsequent C-section. To date, research has demonstrated that primary C-sections are associated with breastfeeding noninitiation. However, it is unknown if this association persists after the primary C-section. Furthermore, literature has shown a differing relationship between breastfeeding initiations by marital status. Due to the high proportion of women who give birth while unmarried, investigating differences by marital status will add a significant contribution to breastfeeding literature. This study investigates the association between repeat C-section and breastfeeding initiation within marital status groups using a nationally representative cross-sectional survey. Materials and Methods: Data from the 2004 to 2011 Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System were analyzed. The sample was restricted to women with a previous singleton live birth who had C-section and whose infant was alive at the time of interview (N = 34,854). Multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted to obtain crude and adjusted odds ratio (AOR) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs). Results: After adjusting for potential confounders, married women who had a repeat C-section were 2.2 times (AOR = 2.16, 95{\%} CI = 1.69-2.77) more likely to never breastfeed compared to women with vaginal birth after caesarean section (VBAC). Similarly, the odds of breastfeeding noninitiation were 76{\%} (AOR = 1.76, 95{\%} CI = 1.47-2.12) higher among women with a repeat C-section compared to women with VBAC. No significant associations were exhibited among nonmarried women. Conclusions: Enhanced educational programs and counseling support may be needed to help families cope with delivery challenges and resulting stressors that may reduce their desire to initiate breastfeeding in the postpartum period.},

abstract = {Objective: This study compared breastfeeding initiation following repeat cesarean delivery, successful vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC), and unsuccessful trial of labor. Subjects and Methods: We performed a population-based retrospective cohort study of Ohio births (2006-2007) with a previous cesarean delivery. The primary outcomes were breastfeeding initiation rates among women with a previous cesarean delivery. Breastfeeding initiation rates were compared among three different delivery types: repeat cesarean delivery, successful VBAC, and unsuccessful trial of labor. Sociodemographic factors, medical risk factors, and pregnancy-related risk factors were also compared to assess influence on breastfeeding initiation rates. Results: Women delivered by successful VBAC were 47{\%} more likely to initiate breastfeeding than women delivered by scheduled repeat cesarean (adjusted relative risk 1.47; 95{\%} confidence interval 1.35, 1.60). Women who ultimately delivered by cesarean section with unsuccessful trial of labor were also more likely to breastfeed than women with a scheduled repeat cesarean section (61{\%} vs. 58.7{\%}, respectively) (adjusted relative risk 1.17; 95{\%} confidence interval 1.04, 1.33). Conclusions: Patients who undergo a scheduled repeat cesarean delivery are less likely to initiate breastfeeding. Women who attempt and succeed in achieving vaginal birth after a previous cesarean section are more likely to breastfeed than are women who deliver by repeat cesarean section. Also, those women who ultimately deliver by cesarean section after an unsuccessful trial of labor were also more likely to breastfeed than those women with a scheduled repeat cesarean section. This suggests there are influences on patient choice for delivery that also may influence the patient's decision to breastfeed. {\textcopyright} 2013, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

@article{Fantini2006,
abstract = {Background: Cesarean section rates is often used as an indicator of quality of care in maternity hospitals. The assumption is that lower rates reflect in developed countries more appropriate clinical practice and general better performances. Hospitals are thus often ranked on the basis of caesarean section rates. The aim of this study is to assess whether the adjustment for clinical and sociodemographic variables of the mother and the fetus is necessary for inter-hospital comparisons of cesarean section (c-section) rates and to assess whether a risk adjustment model based on a limited number of variables could be identified and used. Methods: Discharge abstracts of labouring women without prior cesarean were linked with abstracts of newborns discharged from 29 hospitals of the Emilia-Romagna Region (Italy) from 2003 to 2004. Adjusted ORs of cesarean by hospital were estimated by using two logistic regression models: 1) a full model including the potential confounders selected by a backward procedure; 2) a parsimonious model including only actual confounders identified by the "change-in-estimate" procedure. Hospital rankings, based on ORs were examined. Results: 24 risk factors for c-section were included in the full model and 7 (marital status, maternal age, infant weight, fetopelvic disproportion, eclampsia or pre-eclampsia, placenta previa/abruptio placentae, malposition/malpresentation) in the parsimonious model. Hospital ranking using the adjusted ORs from both models was different from that obtained using the crude ORs. The correlation between the rankings of the two models was 0.92. The crude ORs were smaller than ORs adjusted by both models, with the parsimonious ones producing more precise estimates. Conclusion: Risk adjustment is necessary to compare hospital c-section rates, it shows differences in rankings and highlights inappropriateness of some hospitals. By adjusting for only actual confounders valid and more precise estimates could be obtained. {\textcopyright} 2006 Fantini et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Background: The cesarean section (C-section) has higher risk compared to normal vaginal delivery (NVD). The aim of this population-based study was to evaluate the frequency of mothers' tendency toward the mode of delivery and the factors that can affect this inclination. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted from August 2011 to June 2012 in Fars Province, Iran, and comprised mothers in their 20th to 30th weeks of pregnancy. A questionnaire was designed to include, sociodemographic information, maternal knowledge, main sources of knowledge, attitude of the mother, husband, parents, close friends, and gynecologist, regarding the route of delivery, convenience factors, and barriers to choosing NVD, and mother's preference for the route of delivery. Results: Of 6921 participants, 2197 (31.7{\%}) preferred C-section and 4308 (62.2{\%}) favored NVD while 416 (6{\%}) had no idea regarding the preferred route of delivery. Score of knowledge in 904 (13.1{\%}) participants was zero, and 1261 women (18.2{\%}) achieved an acceptable level of knowledge. Using binary logistic regression, positive history of previous abortion and/or infertility, higher education level of mother and husband, mother's unacceptable level of knowledge regarding complications of C-section, and mother's and husband's positive attitude toward C-section were determinant factors in choosing C-section as a preferred route of delivery. Conclusion: Appropriate measures should be taken to raise awareness and knowledge of mothers and all families about complications of the C-section. Establishment of clinics for painless NVD and assuring mothers of benefits and lower complications of NVD can reduce the tendency for C-sections.},

abstract = {Background: Women's empowerment, and maternal and neonatal health are important targets of the Sustainable Development Goals. Our objective is to examine the relationship between women's empowerment and elective cesarean section (ECS), focusing on Vietnam, a country where the use of CS has increased rapidly in recent decades, which raises public health concerns. Methods: We hypothesized that in the context of the developing biomedicalization of childbirth, women's empowerment increases the use of ECS due to a woman's enhanced ability to decide her mode of delivery. By using microdata from the 2013–2014 Multiple Indicator Clusters Survey, we conducted a multivariate analysis of the correlates of ECS. We studied a representative sample of 1343 institutional single birth deliveries. Due to higher ECS rates among multiparous (18.4{\%}) than primiparous women (10.1{\%}) and the potential interaction between parity and other correlates, we used separate models for primiparous and multiparous women. Results: Among the indicators of women's external resources, which include a higher level of education, having worked during the previous 12 months, and having one's own mobile phone, only education differed between primiparous and multiparous women, with a higher level among primiparous women. Among primiparous women, no resource indicator was significantly linked to ECS. However, considering women's empowerment facilitated the identification of the negative impact of having had fewer than 3 antenatal care visits on the use of ECS. Among multiparous women, disapproval of intimate partner violence (IPV) was associated with a doubled likelihood of undergoing ECS (odds ratio = 2.415), and living in an urban area also doubled the likelihood of ECS. The positive association with living in the richest household quintile was no longer significant when attitude towards IPV was included in the model. In both groups, being aged 35 or older increased the likelihood of undergoing ECS, and this impact was stronger in primiparous women. Conclusions: These results underline the multidimensionality of empowerment, its links to other correlates and its contribution to clarifying the influence of these correlates, particularly for distinguishing between medical and sociocultural determinants. The results advocate for the integration of women's empowerment into policies aimed at reducing ECS rates.},

@article{Wells2018,
abstract = {Background: Among contemporary human populations, rates of cesarean delivery vary substantially, making it difficult to know if the procedure is inadequately available, or used excessively relative to medical need. A much-cited evolutionary hypothesis attributed birth complications to an ‘obstetric dilemma', resulting from antagonistic selective pressures acting on maternal pelvic dimensions and fetal brain growth during hominin evolution. However, the childbirth challenges experienced by living humans may not be representative of those in the past, and may vary in association with trends in ecological conditions. We hypothesized that variability in maternal phenotype (height and nutritional status) may contribute to the risk of cesarean delivery. In many populations, high levels of child stunting contribute to a high frequency of short adult stature, while obesity is also becoming more common. The combination of short maternal stature and maternal overweight or obesity may substantially increase the risk of cesarean delivery. Methods: Using data from two large Indian health surveys from 2005-6 and 2015-2016, we tested associations of maternal somatic phenotype (short stature, overweight) with the risk of cesarean delivery, adjusting for confounding factors such as maternal age, birth order, rural/urban location, wealth and offspring sex. Results: Secular trends in maternal body mass index between surveys were greater than trends in height. Maternal short stature and overweight both increased the risk of cesarean delivery, most strongly when jointly present within individual women. These associations were independent of birth order, wealth, maternal age and rural/urban location. Secular increases in overweight/obesity explained 9{\%} of the secular increase in cesarean rate. Conclusion: Our results highlight how the emerging dual burden of malnutrition (persisting short adult stature which reflects persistent child stunting; increasing overweight in adults) is likely to impact childbirth in low and middle-income countries.},

abstract = {Access to safe Cesarean section (C-section) in resource-constrained settings such as sub-Sahara Africa (SSA) region is a foremost approach to reduce maternal mortality. C-section is an obstetric operative procedure used appropriately to improve delivery outcomes. However, errors in the procedure have enormous potential harm that may outweigh the benefits. This study assessed the prevalence and determinants of C-section in several SSA countries. This study examined the prevalence and determinants associated with cesarean delivery in SSA countries. Secondary data of women of reproductive age (15-49 years) from the current Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) in 34 SSA countries was utilized in this study. The mode of delivery among women was the primary outcome variable. Percentage and descriptive statistics were used to conduct univariate analyses. Furthermore, multivariable multilevel logistic regression was used to investigate correlates of C-section among SSA women. Results showed disparities in the percentage of C-section among women from 34 SSA countries. C-section at public healthcare settings ranged from 3{\%} in Burkina Faso to 15.6{\%} in Ghana. However, in private healthcare settings, C-section ranged from 0{\%} in Sao Tome and Principe to 64.2{\%} in Rwanda. Overall, C-section was 7.9{\%} from public healthcare and 12.3{\%} from private healthcare facilities respectively. In the adjusted regression model; women aged 35–49 had increase in the odds of C-section, while a unit increase in the number of children ever born had 17 and 20{\%} significant reduction in the odds of C-section in public and private healthcare respectively. Assessing public healthcare settings; women from richer/richest households, male and large size children at birth had increase in the odds of C-section, while those from rich neighbourhood had reduction in the odds of C-section. In private healthcare settings, women with high decision making power and multiple births had increase in the odds of C-section, while those who attended ANC visits had significant reduction in the odds of C-section. The findings from this study would help formulate health policies and implement actions that would improve the outcome of C-section care. Monitoring of emergency obstetric care services is necessary to address issues connected to poor C-section outcomes in resource-constrained settings. Also training of medical personnel including midwives and nurses in emergency obstetric care, ensuring accessibility to life-saving drugs and supplies should be encouraged in health care system.},

abstract = {Background: Iran has a high C-section rate (40.6{\%} in 2005). The objective of this study was to assess the associations and population-attributable risks (PAR) of risk factors combinations and Csection in the Southwest Iran. Methods: We performed a population-based cohort study using the reports provided by Shiraz University of Medical Sciences. The cohort included pregnant women within September 2012 and February 2013 (n=4229), with follow-up until delivery. Then, the actual delivery was recorded; i.e., C-section delivery, vaginal delivery, and miscarriage. A multiple logistic regression model was used to estimate the point and the interval probability. The adjusted population attributable risks (aPARs) were calculated through adjusted odds ratio from the final multiple logistic regression models for each variable. Results: Of 4,217 deliveries, 2,624 ones were C-section (62.2{\%}). The rate of C-section was significantly higher in healthcare departments of private clinics compared to governmental clinics. The rate increased steadily with the mother's age, marriage age, family income and education. The multiple logistic regression analysis showed that local healthcare, supplementary insurance, maternal age, age of marriage, place of birth, family income, maternal education, education of husband and occupation were the key contributing factors to choose the mode of delivery. The multiple logistic regression analysis for reproductive factors showed that parity, previous abortion and stillbirth, previous infertility, birth weight (g) and number of live births were selected risk factors for C-section. Among the exposures, family income, location of healthcare and place of birth showed the highest population attributable risks: 43.86{\%}, 19.2{\%} and 18.53{\%}; respectively. Conclusion: In this survey, a relatively large contribution of non-medical factors was identified against the background of C-section. All of these factors influence the knowledge, attitudes and norms of the society. Thus, the attention of policymakers should be drawn to the factors associated with this mode of delivery.},

abstract = {Background. Though emerging evidence indicates caesarean section (CS) brings about late initiation of breastfeeding, early cessation of breastfeeding, and a higher risk of developing obesity, little is documented on the association between CS birth and stunted growth. This study assessed caesarean section delivery and the risk of poor postnatal childhood growth. Methods. A retrospective cohort study design was used to collect the requisite data on a sample of 528 mothers having children between the ages of 6 to 24 months. An interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect the data. Results. After controlling for potential confounding factors, linear growth as measured by height-for-age Z-score (HAZ) was significantly higher by 0.121 standard units in children born through normal vaginal delivery, compared to their counterparts born through caesarean section (beta coefficients ($\beta$) = 0.121, p=0.002). The mode of delivery also had a statistically significant impact on infant feeding practices. Whereas 70.4{\%} of babies delivered via vagina initiated breastfeeding within one hour of delivery, only 52.7{\%} of babies born through CS did the same. Vaginally delivered babies were 2.1 times more likely to initiate breastfeeding within one hour of delivery ((Crude odds ratio (COR) = 2.13, p{\textless}0.001). Compared to CS babies, vaginally delivered babies were 3.2 times more likely not to have been fed with prelacteal feeds such as water and sugar solutions. Vagina delivered babies were 1.8 times more likely to receive adequate neonatal feeding than their counterparts who were delivered through CS (COR = 1.76, p=0.003). Conclusions. This study has found an association between CS delivery and stunting, an adverse outcome that clinicians and patients should weigh when considering in particular elective CS that seeks to avoid the pain associated with a vaginal birth.},

However, access to safe Cesarean section in resource-limited settings is much lower, estimated at 1-2{\%} reported in sub-Saharan Africa. This study reports Cesarean sections rates and indications in Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi, and Sierra Leone, and describe the main parameters associated with maternal and early neonatal mortality. Methods: Women undergoing Cesarean section from August 1 2010 to January 31 2011 were included in this prospective study. Logistic regression was used to model determinants of maternal and early neonatal mortality. Results: 1276 women underwent a Cesarean section, giving a frequency of 6.2{\%} (range 4.1-16.8{\%}). The most common indications were obstructed labor (399, 31{\%}), poor presentation (233, 18{\%}), previous Cesarean section (184, 14{\%}), and fetal distress (128, 10{\%}), uterine rupture (117, 9{\%}) and antepartum hemorrhage (101, 8{\%}). Parity {\textgreater}6 (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 8.6, P = 0.015), uterine rupture (aOR = 20.5; P =. 010), antepartum hemorrhage (aOR = 13.1; P =. 045), and pre-eclampsia/eclampsia (aOR = 42.9; P =. 017) were associated with maternal death.

abstract = {Summary. The use of caesarean section (C.S.) has been analysed in the 12 hospitals of the Midlands Province of Zimbabwe during a 2‐year period. Maternal mortality rate, perinatal mortality rate, low birthweight rate, percentage of high risk pregnancy, C.S. rate and instrumental delivery rate have been extracted for each hospital. The rate of C.S. delivery varied between 2.2 and 16.8 per 100 deliveries but was not correlated with the number of high‐risk pregnancies. Increased use of C.S. was not linked to better perinatal results. An important determinant of the C.S. rate appears to be the physician and the ratio between the rate of instrumental deliveries (ID) and C.S. differentiated the 12 hospitals into two groups. Although there was no difference in the number of high risk patients in these two groups, outcomes were much better in the hospitals with a high ID rate than in the hospitals with a high C.S. rate, suggesting that attitudes of medical staff can influence both the mode of delivery and the perinatal outcome in a developing country.

abstract = {Access to safe Cesarean section (C-section) in resource-constrained settings such as sub-Sahara Africa (SSA) region is a foremost approach to reduce maternal mortality. C-section is an obstetric operative procedure used appropriately to improve delivery outcomes. However, errors in the procedure have enormous potential harm that may outweigh the benefits. This study assessed the prevalence and determinants of C-section in several SSA countries. This study examined the prevalence and determinants associated with cesarean delivery in SSA countries. Secondary data of women of reproductive age (15-49 years) from the current Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) in 34 SSA countries was utilized in this study. The mode of delivery among women was the primary outcome variable. Percentage and descriptive statistics were used to conduct univariate analyses. Furthermore, multivariable multilevel logistic regression was used to investigate correlates of C-section among SSA women. Results showed disparities in the percentage of C-section among women from 34 SSA countries. C-section at public healthcare settings ranged from 3{\%} in Burkina Faso to 15.6{\%} in Ghana. However, in private healthcare settings, C-section ranged from 0{\%} in Sao Tome and Principe to 64.2{\%} in Rwanda. Overall, C-section was 7.9{\%} from public healthcare and 12.3{\%} from private healthcare facilities respectively. In the adjusted regression model; women aged 35–49 had increase in the odds of C-section, while a unit increase in the number of children ever born had 17 and 20{\%} significant reduction in the odds of C-section in public and private healthcare respectively. Assessing public healthcare settings; women from richer/richest households, male and large size children at birth had increase in the odds of C-section, while those from rich neighbourhood had reduction in the odds of C-section. In private healthcare settings, women with high decision making power and multiple births had increase in the odds of C-section, while those who attended ANC visits had significant reduction in the odds of C-section. The findings from this study would help formulate health policies and implement actions that would improve the outcome of C-section care. Monitoring of emergency obstetric care services is necessary to address issues connected to poor C-section outcomes in resource-constrained settings. Also training of medical personnel including midwives and nurses in emergency obstetric care, ensuring accessibility to life-saving drugs and supplies should be encouraged in health care system.},

abstract = {In many African countries, women giving birth still face substantial risks to their own life and that of their baby. In this issue of The Lancet Global Health, David Bishop and colleagues 1 report on maternal and neonatal outcomes after caesarean section in 22 African countries. Their findings suggest that this risk remains true even for women who have access to caesarean delivery in a hospital facility, the highest level of intervention afforded under emergency obstetric care. The 3792 women who had a caesarean section in 2016 form a nested cohort within the African Surgical Outcomes Study (ASOS)-a large prospective observational study of surgical volume and outcomes on the continent that employed a 7-day snapshot data capture method. 2 Over three-quarters of women having caesarean delivery presented emergently, with a high baseline preoperative risk owing to pregnancy-related complications, including pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, placenta praevia, placental abruption, uterine rupture, and antepartum haemorrhage. The study mortality rate after caesarean delivery was 0{\textperiodcentered}5{\%} (95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}3-0{\textperiodcentered}8), with a maternal mortality rate of 5{\textperiodcentered}43 per 1000 operations-some 50 times higher than in high-income countries. Preoperative major bleeding risk, perioperative haemorrhage, and anaesthesia-related complications (a composite of failed intubation, aspiration, cardiac arrest, and hypoxia) were independently associated with mortality. One in six women developed a perioperative complication, with postpartum haemorrhage being the most common severe complication. Overall neonatal mortality after caesarean section was 4{\textperiodcentered}4{\%} (3{\textperiodcentered}7-5{\textperiodcentered}0), rising to 18{\textperiodcentered}0{\%} for infants delivered at 35 weeks or less gestational age. The study did not capture the overall number of deliveries at each participating hospital, so it is not possible to ascertain the caesarean section rate. However, in many African countries the reported caesarean section rate remains as low as 2-4{\%}, 3 much lower than the 10-19{\%} rate associated with improved maternal and neonatal outcomes at the population level. 4,5 For the most part, the study cohort were young, had low parity, were healthy before pregnancy, and delivered term infants. As the authors acknowledge, 1 owing to the non-representative sampling strategy used, a disproportionate number of participating centres were university-affiliated hospitals providing regionalised or specialised level care, rather than district hospitals, which act as first-level hospital providers of comprehensive emergency obstetric care for most African women (and typically with fewer resources). 6 Two-thirds of patients were from middle-income countries, where access to maternal and neonatal care, including trained obstetric and anaesthesia providers, is on average much better than in Africa's poorest countries. The true morbidity and mortality after caesarean section on the continent is therefore likely to be higher than reported. One of the major challenges with studying maternal mortality after caesarean section with a 7-day data snapshot method is that death is an infrequent outcome (20 deaths of 3792 caesarean sections), even in countries with high rates by global standards. Pooling deaths across health facilities and countries to achieve stable continental-wide estimates and to identify explanatory variables comes at the expense of the contextual granularity required to understand the root causes of each maternal death within a given facility and country. Both approaches are ultimately needed to document the magnitude of the problem and to identify which deaths and complications after caesarean section occur as a result of poor-quality care or failure to rescue and are attributable to processes occurring within the health facility, and which represent shortcomings in the broader health system. An example of the latter would be prehospital delays that result in presentations too late to significantly change the trajectory of the outcome even in the presence of high-quality emergency obstetric care. Despite these limitations, two areas clearly stand out from the study findings as promising intervention points and are well supported by other analyses. 7,8 The first is the crucial need for safe obstetric anaesthesia in sub-Saharan Africa. In the present study, 1 10{\%} of deaths after caesarean section were attributable to anaesthesia-related complications, which are almost always preventable. The consistent use of surgical safety checklists in the operating room (used in only half of all caesarean sections in the present study) and the availability of pulse oximetry and appropriate monitoring for both spinal and general anaesthesia are low-cost interventions that facilitate early identification See Articles page e513},

abstract = {Caesarean section (CS) refers to delivery of a foetus through surgical incisions made through abdominal and uterine walls. It's a life-saving procedure when complications arise during pregnancy. It may be an emergency or a planned procedure. Although desirable, CS may be medically unnecessary. CS is a major procedure associated with imme diate and long-term maternal and perinatal risks and may have implications for future pregnancies. Since 1985, international healthcare community considers ideal rate for CS to be 10-15{\%}. However, in the last decade, there has been concern about the rising rates of CS from as low as 2{\%} in Africa to as high as 50-60{\%} in Dominican Republic and Latin America. To this effect, there have been attempts to regulate the rates, and the Ten Group Classification System under the Robson criteria is such an attempt. CS rates are on the increase due to varying reasons ranging from patient, institutional, care provider and societal factors. There have been modifications in the CS technique and the drugs used postoperatively from Pitocin to addition of Misoprostol. Need has developed from Reproductive Health Specialists to review indications, rates and terminologies used and evaluate practices in low-, middle-and high-income countries regarding CS.},

Its role in labor and delivery care in low-and middle-income countries is complex; in many low-resource settings it is underutilized in the most needy of populations and overused by the less needy, without clear methods to ensure that universal access is available. Additionally, even if universal access were available, it is not evident that these countries would have the capacity or the finances to appropriate meet demand for the procedure, or that patients would want to utilize the care.

abstract = {Background: Caesarean section prevalence is increasing in Asia and Latin America while remaining low in most African regions. Caesarean section delivery is effective for saving maternal and infant lives when they are provided for medically-indicated reasons. On the basis of ecological studies, caesarean delivery prevalence between 9{\%} and 19{\%} has been associated with better maternal and perinatal outcomes, such as reduced maternal land fetal mortality. However, the specific prevalence of obstetric and medical complications that require caesarean section have not been established, especially in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). We sought to provide information to inform the approach to the provision of caesarean section in low-resource settings. Methods: We did a literature review to establish the prevalence of obstetric and medical conditions for six potentially life-saving indications for which caesarean section could reduce mortality in LMICs. We then analysed a large, prospective population-based dataset from six LMICs (Argentina, Guatemala, Kenya, India, Pakistan, and Zambia) to determine the prevalence of caesarean section by indication for each site. We considered that an acceptable number of events would be between the 25th and 75th percentile of those found in the literature. Findings: Between Jan 1, 2010, and Dec 31, 2013, we enrolled a total of 271 855 deliveries in six LMICs (seven research sites). Caesarean section prevalence ranged from 35{\%} (3467 of 9813 deliveries in Argentina) to 1{\%} (303 of 16 764 deliveries in Zambia). Argentina's and Guatemala's sites all met the minimum 25th percentile for five of six indications, whereas sites in Zambia and Kenya did not reach the minimum prevalence for caesarean section for any of the indications. Across all sites, a minimum overall caesarean section of 9{\%} was needed to meet the prevalence of the six indications in the population studied. Interpretation: In the site with high caesarean section prevalence, more than half of the procedures were not done for life-saving conditions, whereas the sites with low proportions of caesarean section (below 9{\%}) had an insufficient number of caesarean procedures to cover those life-threatening causes. Attempts to establish a minimum caesarean prevalence should go together with focusing on the life-threatening causes for the mother and child. Simple methods should be developed to allow timely detection of life-threatening conditions, to explore actions that can remedy those conditions, and the timely transfer of women with those conditions to health centres that could provide adequate care for those conditions.

abstract = {Objectives: To describe the prevalence and determinants of births by caesarean section in private and public health facilities in underserved communities in South Asia. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: 81 community-based geographical clusters in four locations in Bangladesh, India and Nepal (three rural, one urban). Participants: 45 327 births occurring in the study areas between 2005 and 2012. Outcome measures: Proportion of caesarean section deliveries by location and type of facility; determinants of caesarean section delivery by location. Results: Institutional delivery rates varied widely between settings, from 21{\%} in rural India to 90{\%} in urban India. The proportion of private and charitable facility births delivered by caesarean section was 73{\%} in Bangladesh, 30{\%} in rural Nepal, 18{\%} in urban India and 5{\%} in rural India. The odds of caesarean section were greater in private and charitable health facilities than in public facilities in three of four study locations, even when adjusted for pregnancy and delivery characteristics, maternal characteristics and year of delivery (Bangladesh: adjusted OR (AOR) 5.91, 95{\%} CI 5.15 to 6.78; Nepal: AOR 2.37, 95{\%} CI 1.62 to 3.44; urban India: AOR 1.22, 95{\%} CI 1.09 to 1.38). We found that highly educated women were particularly likely to deliver by caesarean in private facilities in urban India (AOR 2.10; 95{\%} CI 1.61 to 2.75) and also in rural Bangladesh (AOR 11.09, 95{\%} CI 6.28 to 19.57). Conclusions: Our results lend support to the hypothesis that increased caesarean section rates in these South Asian countries may be driven in part by the private sector. They also suggest that preferences for caesarean delivery may be higher among highly educated women, and that individual-level and provider-level factors interact in driving caesarean rates higher. Rates of caesarean section in the private sector, and their maternal and neonatal health outcomes, require close monitoring.},

abstract = {Background: Caesarean section is a commonly performed operation on women that is globally increasing in prevalence each year. There is a large variation in the rates of caesarean, both in high and low income countries, as well as between different institutions within these countries. This audit aimed to report rates and reasons for caesarean and associated clinical care practices amongst nine hospitals in the four South East Asian countries participating in the South East Asia-Optimising Reproductive and Child Health in Developing countries (SEA-ORCHID) project. Methods: Data on caesarean rates, care practices and health outcomes were collected from the medical records of the 9550 women and their 9665 infants admitted to the nine participating hospitals across South East Asia between January and December 2005. Results: Overall 27{\%} of women had a caesarean section, with rates varying from 19{\%} to 35{\%} between countries and 12{\%} to 39{\%} between hospitals within countries. The most common indications for caesarean were previous caesarean (7.0{\%}), cephalopelvic disproportion (6.3{\%}), malpresentation (4.7{\%}) and fetal distress (3.3{\%}). Neonatal resuscitation rates ranged from 7{\%} to 60{\%} between countries. Prophylactic antibiotics were almost universally given but variations in timing occurred between countries and between hospitals within countries.

abstract = {Background Caesarean section is considered a relatively preferable and safe method of delivery as compared to normal delivery. Since the last decade, its prevalence has increased in both developed and developing countries. In the context of developing countries viz., South Asia (the highest populated region) and South-East Asia (the third-highest populated region), where a significant proportion of home deliveries were reported,however, the preference for, caesarean delivery and its associated factors are not well understood. Objective To study the caesarean delivery in the South and South-East Asian countries and to determine the factors associated with the preference for caesarean delivery. Methodology Demographic and Health Survey Data on from ever-married women of nine developing countries of South and South-East Asia viz., Vietnam, India, Maldives, Timor-Leste, Nepal, Indonesia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Cambodia have been considered. Both bivariate and binary logistic regression models were used to estimate the propensity of a woman undergoing for caesarean delivery and to assess the influence of maternal socioeconomic characteristics towards the preference for caesarean delivery. Results Obtained results have shown an inclination of caesarean delivery among urban than rural women and are quite conspicuous, but is found to be underestimated mostly among rural women. Caesarean delivery in general is mostly predisposed among women whose baby sizes are either very large or smaller than average, have a higher level of education and place of delivery is private medical institutions. The logistic regression also revealed the influence of maternal socioeconomic characteristics towards the preference for caesarean delivery. Based on nine South and South-East Asian countries an overall C-section prevalence of 13{\%}, but based on institutional births its increase to 19{\%}. The forest plot demonstrated that a significant inclination of C-section among urban than rural regions. In Meta-Analysis, very high and significant heterogeneity among countries is observed, but confirms that in terms of prevalence of C-section all of the countries follow independent pattern. Conclusion Study of seven urban and four rural regions of nine South and South- East Asian countries showed, a significant inclination towards the caesarean delivery above the more recent outdated WHO recommended an optimal range of 10–15{\%}and are associated maternal socioeconomic characteristics. In order to control unwanted caesarean delivery, the government needs to develop better healthcare infrastructure and along with more antenatal care related schemes to reduce the risks associated with increased caesarean delivery.},
